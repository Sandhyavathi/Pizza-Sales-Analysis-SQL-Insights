# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

This project is focused on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. It includes database schema creation, loading data into tables, and running queries for sales analysis. The dataset provides insights into pizza orders, details of each order, and the types of pizzas being sold.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

### 1. Data Files:
- `orders.csv`: Contains information about orders, such as order ID, date, and customer details.
- `order_details.csv`: Contains details of each order, such as pizza type, quantity, and price.
- `pizzas.csv`: Contains information about different pizzas offered, including pizza names and sizes.
- `pizza_types.csv`: Provides details about the types of pizzas, such as their description and category.

### 2. SQL Schema Files:
- `orders.sql`: Script to create the `orders` table to store information about pizza orders.
- `order_details.sql`: Script to create the `order_details` table, detailing each pizza included in an order.
- `pizzas.sql`: Script to create the `pizzas` table, which stores information about the pizzas being sold.
- `pizza_types.sql`: Script to create the `pizza_types` table, categorizing the types of pizzas available.

### 3. Analysis Queries:
The project contains a set of SQL query files that provide analysis on the pizza sales dataset. These queries answer specific questions related to sales performance and customer behavior. The queries are commented within the SQL scripts and described below:

#### Query 1 (`Q1B.sql`):
- **Question**: What is the total number of orders placed in the given period?
- **Query Explanation**: This query calculates the total count of all orders placed by aggregating the `orders` table.

#### Query 2 (`Q2B.sql`):
- **Question**: Which pizza is the most ordered across all orders?
- **Query Explanation**: The query identifies the pizza that appears the most in the `order_details` table by joining it with the `pizzas` table and using an aggregate function.

#### Query 3 (`Q3B.sql`):
- **Question**: What is the total revenue generated by each pizza type?
- **Query Explanation**: This query calculates total revenue by multiplying the quantity of pizzas ordered by their prices and grouping by pizza type.

#### Query 4 (`Q4B.sql`):
- **Question**: What are the top 5 most profitable pizzas?
- **Query Explanation**: This query ranks pizzas based on their total revenue and lists the top 5.

#### Query 5 (`Q5B.sql`):
- **Question**: What are the monthly sales trends for the past year?
- **Query Explanation**: This query groups orders by month and calculates total monthly revenue.

#### Query 6 (`Q6I.sql`):
- **Question**: What is the average number of pizzas ordered per customer?
- **Query Explanation**: This query calculates the average number of pizzas ordered by each customer, grouped by their customer ID.

#### Query 7 (`Q7I.sql`):
- **Question**: How many orders were placed in each city?
- **Query Explanation**: The query provides a breakdown of the total number of orders placed, grouped by city.

#### Query 8 (`Q8I.sql`):
- **Question**: What are the peak order times during the day?
- **Query Explanation**: This query analyzes order timestamps to identify peak hours for pizza orders.

#### Query 9 (`Q9I.sql`):
- **Question**: Which day of the week has the highest pizza sales?
- **Query Explanation**: This query aggregates orders by day of the week to find out which day has the highest number of orders.

#### Query 10 (`Q10I.sql`):
- **Question**: What are the average sales per hour in a day?
- **Query Explanation**: This query groups sales by hour and calculates the average sales for each hour.

#### Query 11 (`Q11A.sql`):
- **Question**: What percentage of orders include more than one pizza?
- **Query Explanation**: This query calculates the percentage of orders that include more than one pizza from the `order_details` table.

#### Query 12 (`Q12A.sql`):
- **Question**: Which pizza category (based on pizza types) is the most popular?
- **Query Explanation**: This query joins the `pizzas` and `pizza_types` tables to determine the most popular category based on order count.

#### Query 13 (`Q13A.sql`):
- **Question**: What is the total revenue generated by each pizza size?
- **Query Explanation**: This query calculates total revenue by pizza size, grouping the sales from the `order_details` and `pizzas` tables.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Create the Database**:
   - Use the provided `.sql` scripts to create the necessary tables in your database.
   - Load the CSV data into the respective tables using the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command or a similar method in MySQL Workbench.

2. **Run the Queries**:
   - Execute the queries from the `Q1B.sql` to `Q13A.sql` files in MySQL Workbench to generate insights and analyze pizza sales.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- **Total Sales**: Aggregate sales figures across all orders.
- **Top-Selling Pizzas**: A breakdown of the most popular pizzas.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly and yearly trends in pizza sales.
- **Customer Order Patterns**: Insights into customer behavior, such as repeat orders and order frequency.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data manipulation, table creation, and query execution.
- **MySQL Workbench**: For running SQL scripts and performing analysis.
